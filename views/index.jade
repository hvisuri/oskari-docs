            h4. How is Oskari implemented?

          div.panel-body
            :markdown
              * Oskari user interface is implemented as a collection of reusable bundles. Bundles are used as uniform containers to ship and share new functionality to the application setups.

              * Additions to existing functionality are implemented as Plugins shipped within the bundles.

              * Server-side functionality of the platform is implemented as a Java servlet, which can also be extended to handle new functionality.

              * Oskari uses standard Open Source components such as OpenLayers, GeoTools, GeoServer, Jackson and jQuery. The developed Open Source code stitches these applications together and makes it possible to extend the functionality of the platform in a coordinated manner.

              * Oskari enables controlled extensibility. The service platform is kept flexible: functionality can be added both to the user interface and the server, and the application libraries can be changed.
